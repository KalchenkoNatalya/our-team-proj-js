##Opportunities provided by our project and features. 

1. First of all, this site is targeted at people who are looking for a place where they can find actual information about the latest films, add them to "My Library" and watch the trailers of these films.
2. When we were developing this project, we were trying to optimise the site as much as possible. That is why "Page speed" at the high level, even counting the fact that we do not have the chance optimise the pictures that we receive from the backend.
3. Moreover the whole site has been adapted for all types of devices, such as `mobile`,`tablet` and `desktop`. You can enjoy our site anywhere and anytime.
4. The last, but not least, feature of our site, when we were developing it, all main colors were set to `:root` which means that you can change any monent, change  any color you want without issues.
